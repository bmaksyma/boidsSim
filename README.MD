Boids â€“ Flocking Simulation

This project implements a 2D simulation of swarm flocking behavior (boids) with predators. Programming language: C++. 

Compilation

The project uses a Makefile for compilation. Used a GCC compiler.
Vectors for the simulation are used from sfml. To compile install the sfml library using:
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

In Makefile change line 24, 28, 29 with your information:
    - IP of MZ_APO
